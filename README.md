# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors game :D


Trying to make a rock paper scissors game in Python, wish me luck
This is the plan
	1.	Create a randomized list with rock, paper, and scissors
	2.	Ask the user to type in rock, paper, and scissors
	3.	Print the randomized item and user input
	4.	Ask to play again
 
I'm also gonna add gui
